## **|About Me|:**
  **|UNDO|**
  > I'm Undomyr/Redomyr, I use both names for separate things, but both are me.
  > Since a few years I've been spending most of my time messing with code I can't
  > understand, yet hack at it until it works.
  
  > With no formal education, I mostly learn through doing. Anything I don't understand
  > is a new opportunity to increase my knowledge about all things related to computers
  > and how we communicate with them.
  
  > I'm always up for some code-bashing, decompiling or just messing around with an editor.
